The series follows Olson's son, Eric, on his decades-long quest to identify the mysterious circumstances surrounding his father's death and figure out exactly what happened. As part of the search for information, Eric checks into the hotel room in which his father was staying on that fateful day and a forensics expert exhumes Frank's body to find new clues.",

    "full-text": "Reception Study is an interactive sound art work by artist Nick Ryan, in collaboration with mechatronics engineer Sean Malikides.An eight minute loop of intercut BBC TV News footage reporting conflicts in Yemen, Syria, Ukraine and North Korea is projected onto a large screen at one end of the theatre. In front of the screen five navigable fields of light subdivide the space, each of which affords an alternative interpretation of the footage through sound.Viewers are given headphones modified with a be- spoke photosensitive receiver device that senses light and decodes sound vibrations embedded within each field. By walking closer to or further away from the screen and into a particular field the viewer is able to directly influ- ence what they hear as an accompaniment or ‘score’ to the footage they see. Close to the screen the viewer will find an emotional musical accompaniment, borrowing from film drama and computer games such as Lord of theRings and Call of Duty. As the viewer moves further away from the screen what they hear becomes increasingly ‘neutral’ and theoretically of less influence on the image. Towards the back of the room the footage is reunited with its original news soundtrack comprising commentary and sound captured on location by TV News crew. Furthest from the screen, where the viewer’s perspective is widest, only the diegetic environmental sounds of each clip are left, carefully rebuilt using film foley and sound effects techniques, to convey a version of unobserved reality.Reception Study presents the viewer as a ‘co-author’ in what is seen by allowing them to experience how the feeling and meaning of images can be profoundly altered by sound. It thus proposes an analogy to the inevitable disconnect between text and interpretation, reminding us that meaning is not inherent in the text itself but created both within the relationship between text and reader and in the reader’s imagination.",

As with more traditional African exports such as cocoa and gold, the suppliers of this new African commodity hardly benefit from it at all. Deep in the interiors of the Congolese inland, Dutch artist Renzo Martens launches an emancipatory programme that helps the poor become aware of their primary capital resource: poverty. Over several years, Martens singlehandedly undertakes an epic journey. Combining investigative journalism, satire and self-awareness in a deeply singular view, Episode III - ‘Enjoy Poverty’ is ingeniously provocative, ironic and often hilarious, despite the sad reflection staring back in the mirror that he holds up.",

Evaluating these professions in conflux and beyond their (supposed) opposing ideologies and discourses, remains both controversial and complex. Through a critical hermeneutic analysis, this paper highlights key areas of tension regarding the confluence of journalism and arts. It is argued that journalism is and always has been inextricably interwoven with the arts, a shared existence not limited to Western democracies. The article proposes a continuum as a theoretical model for mapping and exploring the coexistence of artistic and journalistic approaches of news and news work. This “arts and journalism” continuum offers a potentially fruitful dimension of studying news work as a form of artistic practice in a variety of contexts. In conclusion, a consideration of “Artistic Journalism” is proposed as a way for the profession to articulate its creative foundation with its goal to pursue the truth, including the intrinsic and affective motivations of its practitioners.",

    "full-text": "The Eyebeam Center for the Future of Journalism (ECFJ) is an experimental grant-making program that supports artists and artist-journalist teams producing innovative and revelatory journalistic work for major media outlets. Underwritten by Craig Newmark Philanthropies, ECFJ is the first initiative of its kind to directly facilitate artists’ major media commissions in the realm of journalism. With the belief that artists are central in the invention and design of our shared future, and also critical in shifting public debate, ECFJ supports the execution of pieces that focus on reimagining the way stories are told, particularly around technology and society. The funds distributed to grantees assist with research, travel, and other expenses many media outlets struggle to cover, allowing stories that are often out of reach in today’s climate to be produced.",

The reports are organised by assessments made by the civilian casualty monitor, Airwars, who has documented the conflict since it began in August 2014. To date, the USA-led Coalition has conceded only 1,190 civilian deaths over its four year campaign against the so-called Islamic State. Conversely, by listening to social media, local news and speaking to monitors on the ground, Airwars has recorded over 28,000 alleged deaths, and places the minimum number of civilians killed by Coalition strikes at 7,000–11,000. In 2017, a New York Times article called the civilians killed by Coalition strikes, “the uncounted”. For the philosopher, Judith Butler, they are the “ungrievable”. In other words, those whose deaths do with fit within the narrative frame of war.",

    "full-text": "Infoesque (2017) is a new series of larger works on canvas that explore the design strategies of Rumiyah magazine, which took over the propaganda mantel when Dabiq ceased publication in October 2016. The pages are presented as posters focusing deliberately on the use of Islamic art and data visualizations as two forms of authoritative aesthetics deployed by Daesh in their self-branding. These works pick out uneasy pairings of Islamic arabesques with military campaigns, and calligraphic swirls with warnings of the hell fire waiting for the unbelievers.Infoesque explores the identity of ISIS propaganda magazines as an object, originally designed to be viewed in spreads but, given its digital nature, only ever read as a vertically scrolling PDF. The paintings aim to give physical presence to a propaganda device that, as a downloadable file, remains ephemeral and corruptible. The content is reduced to columns and blocks of color where text and image once were, focusing our attention on the compositions of information.",

Beautiful in their own right, the works are also haunting reminders of what really goes on behind the scenes in the American military/political power system. Documents address counter-terrorism, prisoner abuse, and even the threat of Osama Bin Laden. Some of the documents are almost completely inked out, like Colin Powell's memo on Defense Intelligence Agency reorganization. Others are spotty enough to allow readers to try to fill in the blanks. As Roberta Smith wrote in the New York Times, these are \"the hardest-hitting, least hypothetical texts of Holzer's career.",

    "full-text": "I Thought I Was Seeing Convicts is a video containing images from a maximum-security prison in Corcoran, California. The surveillance camera shows a yard where the prisoners are allowed to spend half an hour each day. Fights often break out between inmates, guards call out warnings and fire rubber bullets, if the convicts do not stop fighting, the guards will shoot live ammunition. This experimental documentary tackles the brutal realm of prison surveillance through the use of split-screen, voice-over commentary alternating with silence, and explanatory infographics. The video installation presents complex imagery from practices of watching and being watched, control and the gaze throughout private and public spaces.I Thought I Was Seeing Convicts narrates evidence of surveillance and prison abuse. The use of found footage and archival images manifests the evidence through a video documentary. The work’s filmic language explores the nature of infrastructural and technical devices that produce intensive surveillance and social control, while the narration illustrates the significance of the images by commenting on the video sequences in the work.",

    "date": "",
    "full-text": "After the refugee camp near Calais that became known as the Jungle was razed in 2016, the hundreds of people who had found shelter and a sense of community there were equally abruptly uprooted, adding yet another sorry episode to the disruption and displacement they had already suffered in their flight from persecution, corruption and the fall-out of war. Imran Perretta’s video 15 days is inspired by the time that he spent in Northern France with former inhabitants of the Jungle, now living rough in the surrounding woods and fields. The title of the piece is not a measure of the length of his stay there but rather a salute to the hastily made-up name of one of the people he befriended, whose alias ’15 days’ might be an allusion to the all-too-brief period of respite since his latest temporary camp was destroyed but might also read as a sardonic rebuke of the interminable nature of the time he has been waiting in limbo, in the hope of a new and better life.Perretta pictures this state of limbo through the otherworldly medium of the computer-generated image, animating this bleak and soulless no man's land with a proud and poignant spoken monologue that is a model of dignity and impassioned humanity. Against a backdrop of dank digital trees and muddy scrubland foliage (interspersed with handheld footage shot on location in France), a tent flaps in the breeze. A simple repository of all that someone has in the world, its flimsy outline is also a reminder of all that stands between them and the world. Even this modest protection rarely lasts very long. Regularly slashed by vigilantes or routinely confiscated by police, for each tent to survive more than fifteen days would be a little miracle in itself. Stark and compelling, Perretta’s video captures the intense emotions of living on the edge and brings them unwaveringly to the centre of our thoughts.",

    "full-text": "Bottled Songs is an ongoing media project depicting strategies for making sense of online terrorist propaganda. Filmmakers and media researchers Chloé Galibert-Laîné and Kevin B. Lee compose letters addressed to each other, narrating their encounters with videos originating from the terrorist group the Islamic State (ISIS). They use a desktop documentary approach to trace and record their investigations playing directly upon their computer screens.This screening presents four chapters from the project. “The Observer” and “Looking Into the Flames” delve deep into the details of individual ISIS videos. “My Crush was a Superstar” and The Spokesman” explore the lives of individuals who appear in the videos.A critical account of the vulnerability of living in today’s online environment, the Bottled Songs project ultimately seeks to generate new ways to counter the terroristic qualities of online media. Central to this is engaging with diverse voices to make sense of the many dilemmas of engaging with the contemporary mediascape.",
