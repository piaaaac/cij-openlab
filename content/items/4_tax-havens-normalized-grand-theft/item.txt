Description: I finally found the time to catch up with the recordings of the MoneyLab conference weekly stream of panels, conversations and presentations. MoneyLab, an event usually held in Amsterdam, gives the stage to critical thinkers, artists, researchers, activists and tech-enthusiasts in search of other economies and financial discourses for a fair society. This year, Aksioma held an extra edition of the event in Ljubljana.
