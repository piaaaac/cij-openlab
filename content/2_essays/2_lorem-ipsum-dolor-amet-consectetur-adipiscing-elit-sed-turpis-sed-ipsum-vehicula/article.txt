## 1. When Art Meets Whistleblowing

“Art as Evidence” is a framework to describe artistic and hacktivist practices able to reveal hidden facts, to expose misconducts and wrongdoings of institutions and corporations, to produce awareness about social, political and technological matters that need public exposure, and in general, to inform about the reality we live in. Art becomes a mean to sensibilise about sensitive issues, generating an in-depth analysis within the framework of social and political action, as well as hacktivism, post-digital culture, and network practices. 

 “Art as Evidence” is a context of artistic exploration, in which the issues under scrutiny are investigated in their imaginative artistic potential, by questioning the concept of “evidence” itself. Tactics are not only the disclosing of information and provoking awareness through artistic interventions, but also encouraging the imagination of alternative models of thinking and understanding, towards the creation of new imaginaries, a methodology that is at the core of artistic experimentation since the Avant-gardes. 

The notion of “Art as Evidence” was inspired by my conceptual exchange with Academy Award-winning filmmaker and journalist Laura Poitras, network security researcher Jacob Appelbaum, and artist and geographer Trevor Paglen. This happened during the process of our sharing for the organisation of the keynote about art and the NSA surveillance at transmediale festival in 2014 (www.transmediale.de/content/keynote-art-as-evidence). In the fall of 2013, Laura Poitras suggested to me the concept of “Art as Evidence” to describe a conceptual zone where to investigate artistic practices that speak and inform about reality, as well as provoke a reaction about it. According to Laura Poitras, connecting art with evidence means to reflect on which are “the tools of communication we can use to translate evidence or information beyond revealing facts, so that people experience that information differently, not just intellectually but emotionally” . Following this perspective, art becomes not only a way to translate information, but also an input to investigate sensitive issues, and to explore and experience them by sharing them with an audience. 

At the core of this curatorial and research analysis is the reflection on artistic and technological practices that work from the inside of social, political and economical systems, questioning such systems themselves. According to Laura Poitras, art is helping in understanding reality, expressing important issues about the real world: “We cannot change reality, but we can say something about it” .

I have been expanding this perspective in the course of my research from 2014 to today by applying the definition of “Art as Evidence” into the curatorial context of the Disruption Network Lab, a series of conference events that I have been organising at the Kunstquartier Bethanien in Berlin since March 2015 (www.disruptionlab.org). 

In my research, I propose to connect the discourse of “Art as Evidence” with my theoretical investigation on “Networked Disruption” (the latter resulted in a manuscript published in 2013 by the Digital Aesthetic Research Centre of Aarhus University), and to expand it to the concept of whistleblowing. In this context, the act of leaking and provoking awareness through truth-telling becomes a central part of the strategy of media criticism, by bringing attention to abuses of governments, institutions and corporations. In this practice-based research framework the objective is to reflect on interventions that work within the systems under scrutiny, and increase awareness on sensitive subjects by exposing misconduct, misinformation and wrongdoing in the framework of politics and society. 

This means to interlink the act of disclosing with the one of creating art, shifting the debate to another level, where whistleblowing becomes a source of creative experimentation. Going beyond the usual dichotomy of researcher and practitioner, the methodology applied on this conceptual framework is to work from within the network configuration under investigation. 

The concept of whistleblowing is presented as something concrete and accessible to a broader public – something that everyone can experience and expand into the framework of artistic and activist practices. Furthermore, the concept of “evidence” itself is questioned, by applying it into a context of imaginary experimentation, as the artistic one can be.
In September 2015, the theoretical and practical sharing over the concept of “Art as Evidence” was taken up further in the context of the exhibition “SAMIZDATA: Evidence of Conspiracy”, the first solo show in Germany of Jacob Appelbaum, that I curated at the NOME Gallery in Berlin (https://nomegallery.com/exhibitions/samizdata-evidence-of-conspiracy), and in the conference event “SAMIZDATA: Tactics and Strategies for Resistance”, that I organised at the Kunstquartier Bethanien as part of the Disruption Network Lab conference series (September 11-12, 2015 (www.disruptionlab.org/samizdata). During the SAMIZDATA conference event, I curated a panel discussion with Laura Poitras, Jacob Appelbaum and Theresa Züger on September 11, where we had occasion to develop further our reflections on the matter (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyZAYanzMKw).

## 2. Post-Prism Disruption

In the book Networked Disruption: Rethinking Oppositions in Art, Hacktivism and the Business of Social Networking (Aarhus University, 2013) I analyse the concept of “Disruption” from a socio-political perspective, in relation to art and hacktivism. The notion of “Disruptive Businesses” is used for reflecting on different modalities of generating criticism, shedding light on contradictions and ambiguities both in capitalist logic and in artistic and hacktivist tactics . In the recent development of the information economy, business and its antagonism have become functional to each other, as it is demonstrated by the progressive commercialisation of openness, Do-It-Yourself and hacker ethics by social media platforms and networking enterprises. In the field of network economy, sharing values and business development are often intertwined, generating a feedback loop of disruptions and co-optations of hacker and artistic practices that is instrumental to the development of capitalism. 

In my theory of “Networked Disruption” I propose a model of research based on the disruptive mutual interferences between political activism, technological innovation and artistic creation rather than on the analysis of cyclical phases of appropriation and destruction operated by capitalism . By substituting the idea of cyclical capitalistic appropriation with the analysis of a coexistence of mutual feedback loops between business and its antagonism, I propose to analyse critical practices that happen through business instead of in opposition to it. The reason for this conceptual shift derives from the need of finding new strategies that go beyond the mere act of opposition and are harder to appropriate. 

Through a feedback-loop-model based on the coexistence of art, business development and their disruption, I propose to bypass the classic power/contra-power strategy which often serves to indirectly legitimate the adversary, imagining new radical routes based on the act of provoking disruptive and ironic interventions as an art form. The choice of basing my analysis on “Disruption” is motivated by the two-sided interpretation of the concept, which addresses both a methodology of generating criticism and a strategy of business innovation, that come from within systems. 

In the business world, disruption happens when an innovation is introduced into a market, which the market does not expect, displacing an earlier technology and producing new business values and behavioural tendencies . Transferring the idea of “Disrupting Business” to the field of art and activism, it is possible to imagine a speculative approach where disruption becomes a means to generate practices and interventions that are unexpected, and play within the systems. Therefore, “Disrupting Business” becomes a practice of artistic and hacktivist criticism, and a media tactic where economical, political and technological systems are perturbed from the inside. This happens by first understanding the logics of such systems, and consequently stretching them to their limits, by imagining possible bugs and zones of intervention that are functional to provoke awareness, and to expose contradictions .

By further operating a symbolic appropriation of the term “Disruption” as the act of generating criticism within closed systems, and transferring it to the contexts of whistleblowing and truth-telling, a new terrain of investigation opens up. The objective is to explore the current transformation of political and technological criticism in times of increasing geopolitical surveillance, analysing disruptive methods of intervention, which reconnect with the concept of producing evidence as artistic practice. Adopting a comparative approach not only conceptually (researching the mutual interferences between whistleblowing, information technology and disruption), but also shedding light on heterogeneous practices that generate unexpected consequences inside of social, political and economical systems, the objective is to encourage a topical examination of critical strategies developed by artists, activists and hackers in the framework of the Snowden debate and beyond.

## 3. Resisting the Normalisation of Surveillance

As Glenn Greenwald points out in his book No Place to Hide, reflecting on the harm of surveillance in society, “Only when we believe that nobody else is watching us do we feel free – safe – to truly experiment, to test boundaries, to explore new ways of thinking and being, to explore what it means to be ourselves. What made the Internet so appealing was precisely that it afforded the ability to speak and act anonymously, which is so vital to individual exploration. 

For that reason, it is in the realm of privacy where creativity, dissent, and challenges to orthodoxy germinate” . 
This point is crucial to sensibilise people on the use of code and software for protecting privacy, improving tools of counter-surveillance and anonymity. However, if we assume that today there is “No Place to Hide”, as proven by the global surveillance disclosures of Edward Snowden, how can we imagine tactics of criticism and artistic experimentation that happen within the context of individual supervision? From one side the perception of constant surveillance might be a limitation to imagination. From the other side, if the idea of being surveilled has been normalised, we could start imagining how to produce artistic explorations that come from within systems of monitoring and oppression. 

There is a potential risk in living with the perception of being monitored through pervasive surveillance. As Greenwald himself suggests, reconnecting his reflections with the ones of Michael Foucault in Discipline and Punish, “those who believe they are watched will instinctively choose to do that which is wanted of them without even realizing that they are being controlled” . In the context of the debates on revelations about state surveillance networks and the NSA programmes, the challenge becomes to find terrains of struggles and interventions assuming we are easily watched. 

As the hacktivist and researcher Jaromil writes in his abstract for the talk Demilitarize technology: An insider's critique of contemporary hacker politics, “On a subjective level, while we constantly risk to be obsessed by revelations about the global surveillance panopticon and the military-industrial complex, we are also exposed to mass-deceiving propaganda and media manipulations, while even inter-personal communication becomes a field for the expanding narrative of total war” . What he advocates to circumvent the shared “grim aura” of fear and individualism over our capacity to imagine a better society, is “the possibility for a hacker subject to maintain integrity and seek a positive constituency for her relations” by growing socially oriented networks of trust. This implies a reflection on collective empowerment, opening up the discourse of whistleblowing to a broader community of people. 

In a panel at the conference event SAMIZDATA: Evidence of Conspiracy, network security researcher Jacob Appelbaum observes that surveillance forces you to do things that you are supposed to do. By normalising surveillance, we legitimate systemic power structures and asymmetries in society. He points out that surveillance is only an aspect of a broader political structure, whilst the challenge is to work on liberating each other provoking systemic changes: “Whistleblowing is a tactic but it is not a whole strategy, it is not enough on its own. We should find a terrain of struggles in the information society” . 

In the same panel, speaking about information asymmetry, researcher on civil disobedience Theresa Züger points out that State and corporations gather information about us, but we don’t have information about how much we are surveilled: “Whistleblowing is breaking this, by directly intervening within politics, and changing what we know. It is not only a symbolic gesture of disobedience, but people have taken enormous risks” . 

This debate relates also with the discourse of how it is possible to empower a broader group of people lowering the risks, distributing the potential punishment and sharing the information that only few people have access to, as for example the Snowden Files. The models of disclosing information we have been witnessing until now are diverse, going from leaking the information to specific organisations, as whistle-blower Chelsea Manning did passing her material to WikiLeaks; to appointing some specific people to filter information, as Edward Snowden did by trusting Gleen Greenwald and Laura Poitras; to leaking large information via BitTorrent and Mega, as it happened in July 2015 in the case of the hack of the Hacker Team data by Phineas Fisher, and the reporting of evidence by Citizen Lab of targeting human rights activists via the Remote Control System (RCS), the surveillance software provided by the Hacking Team company. 

In the case of the Snowden Files, in July 2014 journalist and curator Krystian Woznicki started a public debate with the title “Open the Snowden Files! Raising New Issues of Public Interest”, which was largely commented online in the website of the Berliner Gazette . Woznicki argues that “the access to the documents of the NSA-Gate remains closed” and “This blocks the democratic potential of the Snowden disclosures” . Laura Poitras, referring to her activity of reporting the Snowden disclosures and her contact with the source, points out that “it is a very justified criticism just in terms of how to scale the reporting, and it certainty has been a challenge, but it is also about how you build this kind of relationship and networks of trust, and they have been hard to balance” . In the chapter “The Fourth Estate” about the role of political media, in the book No Place to Hide, Glenn Greenwald describes the power dynamics that are at stake when media subservient to government try to discredit him for reporting on sensitive issues and working with a source that disclosed classified information. Many parallel issues play a role: the trust of the source that wanted to coordinate the reporting via specific journalists, the clear risks of punishment from the powers of government, and the sensitive choice of deciding what is appropriate of reporting and what is not. At the end of his book, he writes: 

“The prevailing institutions seem too powerful to challenge; orthodoxies feel too entrenched to uproot; there are always many parties with a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. But it is human being collectively, not a small number of elites working in secret who can decide what kind of world we want to live in. Promoting the human capacity to reason and to make decisions: that is the purpose of whistle-blowing, of activism, of political journalism. And that’s what is happening now, thanks to the revelations brought about by Edward Snowden” .
Between the end of the 1990s and beginning of the 2000s, in the so-called Media Art scene the debate about the collectivisation of media tactics was central. Today, the challenge becomes to imagine a distributed range of practices able to bring back a shared perception of power, which should not only rely on the traditional mass media system, but also reflect on strategies of collective actions and interventions – providing solutions, which are political and not merely technological. 

According to Jacob Appelbaum, “Art can challenge the security economics of surveillance. It is not necessarily against surveillance; it is rather for the freedom and the right to connect to each other, and to do so in a secure way” .

## 4. Artistic Practice as Evidence of Reality

In April 2012 Laura Poitras held a surveillance teach-in at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. For this programme Jacob Appelbaum and NSA whistle-blower William Binney joined her to discuss on state surveillance, civil right to privacy, and how technological innovations is legitimating pervasive access to private information. The event happened in the context of the work of Laura Poitras, who has chronicled America post-9/11 with her trilogy of films My Country, My Country (2006), The Oath (2010), and Citizenfour (2014), the Award winning documentary on the surveillance state and Edward Snowden’s disclosures. 

During an interview we had in November 2013, Laura Poitras pointed out: “Doing this work on America post-9/11 issues I’m interested in documenting how America exerts power in the world. I’m against the documentary tradition of just going to the ‘third world’ and filming people suffering outside of context. I don’t want the audience to think that it’s some other reality that they have no connection with. I want to emotionally implicate them in the events they are seeing” . Her solo show at the Whitney Museum of American Art, opened in February 2016, followed this perspective, where she created installations of immersive environments combining various material, from footages to information around NSA surveillance and post-9/11 America (Laura Poitras: Astro Noise; February 5-May 1, 2016). 

In the line of the discourse of imagining art as a mean to speak about reality, in February 2014 I curated a panel at transmediale festival with Laura Poitras, Jacob Appelbaum and Trevor Paglen. In this specific occasion, the filmmaking work of Poitras was combined with the secret geographies of Trevor Paglen and the infrared photography of Jacob Appelbaum. The concept of surveillance was translated and explored through concrete artistic examples, interlinking various areas of expertise. In the 2010 photographic monograph Invisible: Covert Operations and Classified Landscapes, Trevor Paglen explores the secret activities of the U.S. military and intelligence agencies creating photos of top-secret sites that are not accessible, but that can be mapped, and brought to evidence. Photography becomes a mean of truth-telling, revealing to the public the existence of secret operations, depicting both what can and cannot be seen. High-end optical systems are used to document governmental locations, as well as classified spacecraft in Earth’s orbit are photographed tracking data of amateur satellite watchers. In Paglen’s series of drones’ photography, we see an apparently normal landscape, but only when the photo is exposed to his maximum resolution, we are able to disclose drones in the sky, and therefore have an idea of clandestine military activities that are happening on the American landscape.  

This artistic practice, which works as evidence of reality, is conceptually related with the infrared photographic works by Jacob Appelbaum. The solo show SAMIZDATA: Evidence of Conspiracy, which I curated at the NOME Gallery in Berlin in the fall of 2015, presented six cibachrome prints (a fully analogue positive slide printing technique), portraying Bill Binney, Laura Poitras, Glenn Greenwald with David Miranda, Julian Assange, Sarah Harrison and Ai Weiwei, as well as two installations: P2P Panda-to-Panda, and the necklace piece Schuld, Scham & Angst (Guilt, Shame & Fear). 

The photos are shot using color infrared films, previously adopted to expose hidden details during aerial surveillance, to portray people under surveillance who have themselves worked reporting on governmental misconducts and exposed crimes against civil society. According to Appelbaum, “I think it is beautiful irony and conceptually strong to use surveillance film to critique surveillance culture. In a world of digital surveillance, re-purposing analogue aerial agricultural surveillance film for the portraiture of peoples who are exposed to and who work to expose surveillance seemed the appropriate medium” . The photos, given as a gift by Appelbaum to the people that are portrayed, are also the evidence of a personal network of trust, where grassroots collaboration between trusted people who share passions, ideals and political views is documented. In the context of the interconnected network of artistic evidence, the installation P2P (Panda-to-Panda), created in collaboration with Ai Wei Wei, is a stuffed panda with Snowden materials and other classified documents saved in a SD card, exemplifying a peer-to-peer network of people that got the panda as gift for their struggle for social justice. The project Schuld, Scham & Angst (Guilt, Shame & Fear) is instead a 100 necklaces piece containing shredded unreleased documents, journalistic notes, and other classified documents of the last two years of reporting on the Snowden files, which are thought to be pieces of evidence carried around by people, to symbolise the shame and guilt of shredding sensitive documents, as often the society force us to do. 

Another project resulting from collaboration between Jacob Appelbaum and Trevor Paglen is the Autonomy Cube sculpture. The cube, which works as a node in the Tor network, gives the visitors access to the Tor network, and a copy of the Tor program, turning the museum into a space for free speech and autonomy. By making the cube entering into a cultural context, “it allows art institutions to actually be part of a worldwide network of things such as opening up lines of communication, securing people’s fundamental right to anonymity, to free speech and thus to human rights” . 
Returning to the speculative conceptual matter of disrupting closed systems from the inside as artistic and hacktivism practice, I propose to open up a field of artistic research and practice where the fight against surveillance and for the protection of civil rights and social justice become a terrain of intervention by understanding the logic of systems of power: Government agencies, private enterprises and corporations that base their profit on the collection of meta-data, as well as intelligence services that are basing their business in tracking and surveilling people. 
Thirty-two years ago Norwegian researcher, journalist and whistleblower Jørgen Johansen exposed the sites of secret NATO military bases in Norway, combining and analysing public records, freely accessible to everyone. The government considered his publications as disclosing of classified information and prosecuted him with espionage charges. In an interview in September 2015, he points out: “If you are a person who thinks the world should be better, you must act in a way that gives the opposition movements around the world the possibility to do their jobs. If you’re just an obedient consumer or an obedient citizen, you’re letting surveillance continue on those who really have something to hide because they are the state’s opposition” . 

The German artist collective Peng! On September 2015 launched their campaign Intelexit, inviting people inside of the secret services, as well as intelligence agencies, to blow the whistle, and make a stand, and to open up the practice of whistleblowing to the broader society (www.intelexit.org). This initiative promoted whistleblowing as a common practice, by building up a support structure and a safety network to enable whistleblowing taking into account the risks of this. The campaign used disruptive methods to intervene within intelligence systems – such as placing unexpected billboards in front of intelligence services offices, distributing flyers via drones flying over NSA bases, etc. – to open up a debate about the issues of surveillance and truth-telling, as well as the importance of sources’ protection.

The act of speaking out as a tactic of resistance is not new, but it deserves an in-depth analysis especially today, when the debate about surveillance and big data is involving an increasing audience. 

This essay is an invitation to discuss, reflect and develop new artistic practices that take inspiration by, but also go beyond, the Snowden disclosures, to open up the fight against surveillance to a broader community. “Art as Evidence” therefore means, in this context, to explore the current transformation of political and technological criticism in times of increased geopolitical surveillance, analysing disruptive methods and artistic practices to question and produce evidence. Artistic works on “Evidence” become therefore not only a challenge to expose facts and wrongdoings that are hidden and not accessible to the general public, but also to collectively question the concept of evidence itself, and to reflect on which speculative forms of artistic research and practice might arise from its analysis.
