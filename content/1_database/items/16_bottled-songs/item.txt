Description: Bottled Songs is an ongoing media project depicting strategies for making sense of online terrorist propaganda. Filmmakers and media researchers Chloé Galibert-Laîné and Kevin B. Lee compose letters addressed to each other, narrating their encounters with videos originating from the terrorist group the Islamic State (ISIS). They use a desktop documentary approach to trace and record their investigations playing directly upon their computer screens.This screening presents four chapters from the project. “The Observer” and “Looking Into the Flames” delve deep into the details of individual ISIS videos. “My Crush was a Superstar” and The Spokesman” explore the lives of individuals who appear in the videos.A critical account of the vulnerability of living in today’s online environment, the Bottled Songs project ultimately seeks to generate new ways to counter the terroristic qualities of online media. Central to this is engaging with diverse voices to make sense of the many dilemmas of engaging with the contemporary mediascape.
