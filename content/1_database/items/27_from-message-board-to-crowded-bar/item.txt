Description: Artist Angela Washko gives us a behind-the-scenes look into her latest video game, “The Game: The Game,” which exposes misogyny from lived-experience to online message boards. “The Game” allows for players to recognize the patterns of the male-seduction community through a simulation that interacts with infamous pick-up artists.
