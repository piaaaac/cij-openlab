Description: “Imagine this for a second,” Mark Zuckerberg intones in a measured voice as a news ticker below him flashes a message about ad transparency on screen. “One man with total control of billions of people’s stolen data, all their secrets, their lives, their futures.” The Facebook CEO goes on to thank a mysterious entity called “Spectre” for showing him that “whoever controls the data, controls the future.”
