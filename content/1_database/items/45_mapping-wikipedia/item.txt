Description: In Mapping Wikipedia, Michael discovered a data set that offered an entry point into the geography of Wikipediaâ€™s contributors. By parsing 884 million edits to English Wikipedia, they were able to collect and geolocate 43 million IP addresses, determining some troubling patterns: high edits in swing states; low edits in religious counties in the Plains; low edits in Black rural South and Native American reservations.
