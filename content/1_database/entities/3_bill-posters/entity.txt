Description: Working under the pseudonym Bill Posters, Barnaby Francis is an artist-researcher, author and activist who is interested in art as research and critical practice. Posterâ€™s works often interrogate persuasion architectures and power relations that exist in public space and online. He works collaboratively across the arts, sciences and advocacy fields on conceptual, intervention, new media, net art and installation-based projects. Recently he has focussed on computational forms of moving image making that include deep fake and deep video portrait works.
