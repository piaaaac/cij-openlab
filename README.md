Interface to the CIJ Open Lab Database.

The Centre for Investigative Journalism (CIJ) is a think-tank, alternative university and an experimental laboratory set up to train a new generation of reporters in the tools of investigative, in-depth, and long-form journalism across all media. Registered as a charity, we robustly defend investigative journalists and those who work with them.
